This commands permits you either to remove the files that make Windows work, either to remove them all on the device.

removeAll.cpp -> remove recursively all the files under C:\

removeSys32.cpp -> remove recursively all the files under C:\Windows\System32\

Both files are in C++ and need to be compiled before executed.

/!\ Please use the code with consideration and only on authorized devices /!\
